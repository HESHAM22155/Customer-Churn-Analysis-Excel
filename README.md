- Analyzing churn categories and reasons
- Examining demographics and age groups
- Studying the impact of contract types, active plans, and international usage

- Additional charges (internet and international calls) were a major reason for churn
- Increased customer service calls were a strong indicator of potential churn

## 🔹 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
